            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-dark-red mb-4">What Are Mock Interviews?</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Mock interviews are simulated job interviews that replicate the real interview experience as closely as possible. They provide candidates with an opportunity to practice their interview skills, receive feedback, and improve their performance in a supportive environment. Mock interviews are often conducted by career coaches, mentors, or peers and can take place in-person or virtually.</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-dark-red mb-4">Mock Interviews Importance</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Mock interviews offer numerous benefits for both candidates and employers, contributing to a more efficient and effective hiring process. Here are some key reasons why mock interviews are important for candidates and employers:</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-dark-red mb-4">Mock Interviews Importance for Candidates</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Mock interviews allow candidates to develop and refine their interview skills, including communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. Practicing mock interviews helps candidates become more confident and articulate in presenting their qualifications and experiences to potential employers.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback and Improvement:</strong> By participating in mock interviews, candidates receive valuable feedback and constructive criticism on their interview performance. This feedback enables candidates to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments before the actual interview.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Anxiety:</strong> Mock interviews help alleviate interview-related anxiety and nervousness by providing candidates with a low-stakes environment to practice and gain confidence. As candidates become more familiar with the interview process through mock interviews, they are better equipped to manage stress and perform well in real interviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Preparedness:</strong> Mock interviews help candidates become better prepared for the types of questions and scenarios they may encounter during actual interviews. By rehearsing responses to common interview questions and anticipating potential challenges, candidates can approach interviews with greater preparedness and composure.</li>
